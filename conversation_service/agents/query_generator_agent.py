"""Query optimization utilities for conversation service.

This module exposes :class:`QueryOptimizer`, a lightweight helper that applies
post-processing rules to search queries before they are sent to the search
service.  The optimizer understands domain specific intents and adjusts the
query accordingly so that downstream services receive well scoped requests.

Supported optimization rules
----------------------------
* :class:`~conversation_service.models.enums.IntentType.MERCHANT_ANALYSIS` â€“
  limits the number of returned merchants to 15 and applies a deterministic
  sort on the aggregated spend so that the highest spending merchants appear
  first.

Additional rules can be added in the future as new intents require special
handling.
